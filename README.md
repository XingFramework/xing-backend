The Xing Framework: Backend
===

The Xing Framework is a cutting edge web and mobile development platform by
Logical Reality Design, Inc.  It is designed to provide a completely modern
(and even somewhat future-proofed) API + SPA web development platform with
sensible defaults, solid conventions, and ease of rapid development. Xing uses
Rails (4.2) on the backend and AngularJS (1.4) on the frontend.  Most of the
problems inherent in getting these two frameworks to talk to each other cleanly
have been pre-solved in Xing.

This gem is a Rails Engine that implements the extensions necessary for Rails
to function as a Xing back-end API server.
